This is my version of Rails. It's functions include:

1) creating a server that writes the results onto the webpage upon matched url
2) render :name_of_template => finds the template and writes it upon the results page
3) redirect_to :url => matches the url and redirects it
4) stores the session of use to check for authenticity
5) router matches any matched routes and runs the url request
